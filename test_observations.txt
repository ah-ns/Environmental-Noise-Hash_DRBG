test 1: raw temperature all decimal places (3 hour)
	Histogram has a single  spike around 40.5 Celsius, with around 750 frequency
	Approx. range of 39-41 Celsius, with strong left skew

test 2: 5th to 19th decimal places of the temperature (3 hour)
	Histogram has an approximately uniform distribution
	350-400 frequency for each range
	Frequency seems to go down as the numbers increase, unsure if this indicates non-uniformity

test 3: 5th to 19th decimal places of the temperature mod 100 (3 hour)
	Shows about same distribution as test 2, perhaps more evenly uniform

test 4: 5th to 19th decimal place of pressure mod 100 (30 min)
	Could be uniform, but not enough data was collected
	Spike around the 57, with 34 frequency. Next highest has 28
	Lowest frequency is 10 for value 41

test 5: 4th to 10th decimal place of pressure mod 100 (1 hour)
	Looks about uniform except for value 99 which has frequency of about 120.
	2nd highest frequency is < 90, 3rd highest is < 80
	Lowest frequency is about 50
	Realize the sensor may not have the float precision needed, so the decimal places aren't random
